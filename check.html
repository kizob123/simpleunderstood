       <h3 class="topic">A Moving All-Thing:Mass and Velocity</h3>
  <p>Momentum is the product of the mass of a body to its velocity. The change its momentum during impacts with other
  objects. There could be a change in mass during motion, rather than speed and this will cause a change in momentum also.
  Some example where mass could change are airflow, water coming out of a nozzle, sand being pour out of a bag etc.
  <p>For any reason, if the momentum changes, there has to be a force or a force has to cause it to happen. 
  One way to write Newton's second Law is:
  <div class="equation">
                <code>
                       F = d(mv)/dt<br>
        
                </code>
        </div>

      <br>and vectors: <a href="https://simpleunderstood.blogspot.com/p/vectors.html">Vectors</a>
  </p>
  <p>You could write it this way:
  <div class="equation">
                <code>
                       Fdt= d(mv)<br>
        
                </code>

  <p>
  <p>A system consisting of several objects under-going collisions are said to conserve momentum if the change in momentum
  is always zero.
  <p>There are two extremes of collision: perfectly elastic and completely plastic.
  <h3 class="topic">Coefficient of impacts</h3>
  <p>The 'coefficient of restitution' reflects the capacity of the contacting bodies to recover from impact. It is given by the ratio:
  <div class="equation">
                <code>
                       e = (v<sub>22</sub>-v<sub>12</sub>)/(v<sub>1</sub>-v<sub>2</sub>)<br>
      =|velocity of separation|/|velocity of approach|<br> 
                </code>
        </div>
  <p>This means that for e to be 1, the difference in velocities after impact must be the same after impact as before impact. 
  that is for the case of perfectly elastic collisions. If e were zero, there would not be a difference in velocities after impact 
  and that would mean a plastic collision.

  <h3 class="topic">What Gives: Momentum Exchange</h3> 
  <p>When there is a collision, the particles involved undergo changes in momentum. If we consider two bodies only, and say the first
  body with mass m<sub>1</sub> moves with velocity v<sub>1</sub> and the second with mass, m<sub>2</sub> moves with v<sub>2</sub>, and say
  the bodies where moving in the same direction like below:

  <p>It is implied that v<sub>1</sub>>v<sub>2</sub> because that is necessary for collision to occur. v<sub>c</sub> is the 'impact velocity'.
  Just imagine that you run towards your friend as you chase him and you meet him and give him a push. At that push the both of you are moving
  with the same velocity. But v<sub>c</sub> the reduces for m<sub>1</sub> to v<sub>12</sub>and increases for m<sub>2</sub> to v<sub>22</sub>.
  <p>The result is that in the end the total momentum before impact will be the same as that after impact:
  <div class="equation">
                <code>
                      m<sub>1</sub>v<sub>1</sub>+m<sub>2</sub>v<sub>2</sub>=m<sub>1</sub>v<sub>12</sub>+m<sub>2</sub>v<sub>22</sub><br>
        
                </code>
        </div>
  <p>This is for 'direct impacts' where the bodies collide as their centers are moving along paths that have tangents that superimpose and any 
  perpendicular line on both tangents are parallel to each other. There are impacts that are not direct but happens at angles. These impacts need 
  a different or a general kind of approach. The angles introduce velocities from or in two coordinates if you were dealing with plane motion and
  three coordinates if you were dealing with 3-D motion. We will show only plane motion here:
  <h3 class="topic">A Fall Is Covered: Potential Energy</h3>
  <p><span style="font-style:italic">Potential Energy is the set tendencies for an object to do work because how it is oriented if it was let through a threshold,</span> like you would rather get hit by the side of a vehicle than its
  bonnet. You would probably still suffer a fling men, and some scraps and bruises and probably hit the ground hard but you also still probably survive.
  A thing that is heavy and placed well above your head better be sitting tight or else. A sharp knife is badder than a a rock pressed on you.
  <p>In physics books you most likely will deal with things falling through a distance at first. The formula for potential energy of a thing about to fall is:
  <div class="equation">
                <code>
                      P.E = mgh<br>
       m = mass of thing<br>
       g = acceleration due to gravity<br>
       h = height of fall<br>
        
                </code>
    
        </div>
  <p>This energy can become useful when the object does fall or dangerous. In water falls it can be used to turn a turbine which can produce energy. 
  <h3 class="topic">Oncoming and Crashes and Burns Into: Kinetic Energy</h3>
  <p><span style="font-style:italic">Kinetic Energy is the set tendencies for a moving object to do work against a resultant force set up resist it.</span> You would rather be hit by a bicycle
  than a school bus moving at the same speed. The bus is heavier and will possess more force to fight with. But you would rather the bus than a bicycle moving at the speed of
  of a bullet. You would rather not the bullet at all. The formula for kinetic energy is:
  <div class="equation">
                <code>
                      K.E = (1/2)mv<sup>2</sup><br>
       m = mass of thing<br>
       v = velocity at the time of consideration<br>      
        
                </code>
    
        </div>
  <h3 class="topic">One Into The Other: Energy Exchanges</h3>
<p>Energy can be changed from one form into another. You can throw a ball onto the ceiling of your house which means you changed kinetic energy into potential energy.
What actually is happening is  changes. When the kinetic energy of an object changes, that change means something has gone somewhere or has come in from somewhere. Also for
potential energy. If an orange drops from a tree and unto a car, it potential energy changes and just now became kinetic for a short while. There are also other forms energies could
change into like stretch in springs like when kicking the brakes, or heat due to friction when the tyres hit or sound of the tyres... infact they usually happen all at once.... 
<p>The way it is written is:
<div class="equation">
                <code>
                      U = ΔP.E + ΔK.E +ΔOthers<br>
       U = Total energy of the isolated system<br>
       ΔP.E = changes in potential energy<br>
       ΔK.E = changes in kinetic energy<br>
       ΔOthers = changes in other forms of energy like stretches and losses like friction<br>
        
                </code>
